                    <h2>The Importance of Gas Interlock Systems</h2>
                    <p>Gas interlock systems are an essential component of most commercial kitchens, serving as a legal requirement and a crucial safety measure. Failure to comply with the law can lead to severe consequences, including fines, kitchen closure, and risks to the health and safety of your personnel and patrons.</p>
                    <p>At Rowlen Boiler Services, we understand the significance of gas interlock systems, and we are qualified to install them to the required standard. Whether you operate a small eatery or a large-scale restaurant, we have the expertise to seamlessly integrate a gas interlock system into your kitchen setup while minimizing disruptions to your business operations.</p>
                    <h3>Understanding Gas Interlock Systems</h3>
                    <p>In simple terms, a gas interlock system combines the air extraction and input systems in a commercial kitchen with the gas supply. This integration allows for the automatic cutoff of gas in the event of fan failure. By preventing the accumulation of gas within the kitchen, we mitigate the associated risks and ensure a safe environment for your staff and customers.</p>
                    <p>There are several types of gas interlock systems available in the market, each designed for specific circumstances and offering unique advantages and disadvantages. Our team at Rowlen Boiler Services is here to assist you in selecting the system that best suits your kitchen’s requirements. With our unbiased advice, you can make an informed decision that prioritizes safety and compliance.</p>
                    <h3>Legal Requirements and Gas Interlock Systems</h3>
                    <p>To adhere to legal requirements, any kitchen constructed since 2001 must have a gas interlock system installed. Additionally, if you are installing new extraction canopies, gas pipework runs, cook lines, or layout changes, a gas interlock system is mandatory. The installation of Category B equipment, such as deep fryers and combi ovens, also necessitates a gas interlock system.</p>
                    <p>British Standard BS6173 and Gas Safe regulations outline the criteria that gas interlock systems must meet. Failing to comply with these requirements poses unacceptable health and safety risks to both your staff and customers. Non-compliance can result in prosecution by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), fines, kitchen closure until regulations are met, and failed CP42 inspections.</p>

                    <h3>Expert Installation, Repairs, and Servicing</h3>
                    <p>It is crucial to enlist the services of a qualified and certified professional for the installation of a gas interlock system. Attempting to install the system yourself is not only illegal but also extremely hazardous.

                    <p>In addition to installation and repairs, we emphasize the importance of regular servicing for gas interlock systems. Neglecting proper maintenance can lead to dangerous situations. By scheduling routine service with Rowlen Boiler Services, you can ensure that your gas interlock system functions optimally and complies with legal standards. We prioritize the safety of your staff and customers above all else.</p>
                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Who needs a gas interlock system in their commercial kitchen?</strong>
                            <p>If you own a commercial kitchen built after 2001, you are legally required to have a gas interlock system. Additionally, if you are installing specific items in a pre-2001 kitchen, such as extraction canopies or cook lines, a gas interlock system must be installed.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What happens if I don’t have a gas interlock system when legally required?</strong>
                            <p>Failure to have a gas interlock system when legally required can result in prosecution by the HSE, potential business closure, and, most importantly, jeopardizing the lives of your staff and visitors. Compliance with gas interlock system regulations is essential for maintaining a safe working environment.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Can I install or repair a gas interlock system myself?</strong>
                            <p>No, gas interlock systems should only be installed or repaired by certified gas safety engineers. Attempting to handle these systems without proper qualifications is not only illegal but also hazardous. Always ensure that the professionals you hire are qualified and experienced in handling gas appliances and interlock systems.</p>
